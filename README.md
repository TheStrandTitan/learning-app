# Default ReadMe for React app is visible below. Last updated date: 9/12/2024

This is a test project for attempting to implement a React app which utilizes state management. The goal of the project is to accomplish the following:

* Incorperate state management
    Current status: Will need to research and understand how React manages state and how to write my own method of maintaining state.

* Display an image on the main project screen. 
    One image should be static and saved on the project, the other should be a URL-based image.
        Current Status: Two images are added, planning to keep one as the static image and find another one to add in a URL at a later time.

* Use craco with this project and integrate it into the project.
    Current status: Craco is partially configured and utilizes an option to specify developer mode with a few options, as well as running on port 3612.

* Needs to display my name on the banner which is given based upon a variable set in a .env file.
    Current Status: Have not attempted to provide functionality to the feature yet.

* Must be able to run the project in developer mode and production mode.
    Current status: Program has developer mode features (As far as I can understand), but I have not attempted to get it working on a production mode yet.

* Must utilize Docker Desktop for running a container for production mode.
    Current Progress: Haven't started on Docker yet, will need to spend time learning it.






# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
